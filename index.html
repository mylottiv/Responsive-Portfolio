                    It's me. Thomas Raymond Mylott IV. Don't let the fancy name fool you, I'm no royal, I'm just another human being trying to figure this world out. I've gone from being involved in Student Government at the University of Texas at Austin, to "shift lead" (manager without the power or pay of one) at a high volume pizza shop, and now I'm all in on developing my Web and Programming skills, hopefully turning an interest and passion into a career where I can come home every night with a smile on my face :). Overall I'm just a big nerd, I spend way too much time playing old games and reading/watching informational and not so informational things on the internet. Hopefully soon I'll be back into fish and shrimp keeping, once the weather cools down a little (if ever!). Go Detroit Lions, Go Dallas Stars!
