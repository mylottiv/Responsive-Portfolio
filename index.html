                    Kendrick have a dream. I am a sinner who's probably going to sin again. Playstation and some drank. Technology bought my soul. Got me breathing with dragons. I crack the eggs in your basket. I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic. Start up that Maserati and 'Vroom! Vroom' I'm racing. I got 25 lighters on my dresser. I can feel your energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music. I would share them both today. I can feel the changes. I can feel the people around me just want to be famous
